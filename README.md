# Create an AI-driven Supply Chain Management (SCM) dashboard as a portfolio project for GitHub. This will showcase skills in Oracle OCI, Python, AI integration, and data visualization—key areas from  resume and my recommendations. I’ll guide you step-by-step to build it, host it on GitHub, and include a README.md file. We’ll use a web-based approach (HTML/JavaScript) with Python for AI processing, leveraging  full-stack expertise.

# Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Define the Project Scope
Objective: Build a dashboard that uses AI to predict demand and visualize SCM metrics (e.g., inventory levels, shipping delays).
# Features:
AI-driven demand forecast using a simple machine learning model.
Interactive charts for SCM data (e.g., stock levels, shipping status).
Simulated data (since we can’t access real OCI SCM data here).
 Tech Stack:
Python (AI model with Flask for backend).
HTML/JavaScript (Chart.js for frontend).
GitHub for hosting the repo.
# Step 2: Set Up Your Local Environment
Install Prerequisites:
Python 3.x (for AI backend).
Git (for version control).
A code editor (e.g., VS Code).
Create Project Directory:
On your computer, create a folder called ai-scm-dashboard.
Inside it, create subfolders: static (for CSS/JS) and templates (for HTML).
# Step 3: Build the AI Backend (Python with Flask)
We’ll use Flask to serve the dashboard and a simple linear regression model for demand prediction.
Create a file called app.py in the root directory:
app.py
python
# Step 4: Create the Frontend (HTML/JavaScript)
Create templates/index.html for the dashboard UI:
index.html
html
Create static/style.css for basic styling:
style.css
css
# Step 5: Test Locally
Install dependencies: pip install flask numpy scikit-learn.
Run the app: python app.py.
Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser to see the dashboard with demand, inventory, and delay charts.
# Step 6: Set Up GitHub Repository
Initialize Git:
In the ai-scm-dashboard folder, run:
text

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI-driven SCM dashboard"
Create GitHub Repo:
Go to GitHub, create a new repository called ai-scm-dashboard, and follow the instructions to push your local repo:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/ai-scm-dashboard.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
# Step 7: Add README.md
Create README.md in the root directory:
README.md
markdown
# Step 8: Push to GitHub
Add and commit the README:

git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README.md"
git push origin main
git push -f origin main
# Step 9: Polish and Share
Test: Ensure everything works locally and the GitHub repo looks clean.
Enhance: Add a screenshot of the dashboard to the README (upload it to static/ and link it).
Share: Include the GitHub link in your resume or LinkedIn to impress recruiters.

# Final Notes
This project highlights your Oracle-adjacent skills (AI, data integration) and full-stack abilities (Python, web dev). It’s simple enough to complete quickly but extensible for future growth (e.g., OCI integration). Let me know if you want to tweak any part!
